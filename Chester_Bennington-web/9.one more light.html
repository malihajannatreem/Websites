 Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored? <br>
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore? <br>
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep <br>
There are things that we can have, but can't keep <br>
If they say <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out? <br>
In a sky of a million stars <br>
It flickers, flickers <br>
Who cares when someone's time runs out?<br>
If a moment is all we are <br>
We're quicker, quicker <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out? <br>
Well I do <br>
The reminders pull the floor from your feet <br>
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh <br>
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair <br>
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there <br>
If they say <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out? <br>
In a sky of a million stars <br>
It flickers, flickers <br>
Who cares when someone's time runs out? <br>
If a moment is all we are <br>
We're quicker, quicker <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out? <br>
Well I do <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out?<br>
In a sky of a million stars <br>
It flickers, flickers <br>
Who cares when someone's time runs out? <br>
If a moment is all we are <br>
We're quicker, quicker <br>
Who cares if one more light goes out? <br>
Well I do <br>
Well I do
