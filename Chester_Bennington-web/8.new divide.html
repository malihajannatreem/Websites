 I remembered black skies <br>
The lightning all around me <br>
I remembered each flash <br>
As time began to blur <br>
Like a startling sign <br>
That fate had finally found me <br>
And your voice was all I heard <br>
That I get what I deserve br
So give me reason <br>
To prove me wrong <br>
To wash this memory clean <br>
Let the floods cross <br>
The distance in your eyes <br>
Give me reason <br>
To fill this hole <br>
Connect this space between <br>
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies <br>
Across this new divide <br>
There was nothing in sight <br>
But memories left abandoned <br>
There was nowhere to hide <br>
The ashes fell like snow <br>
And the ground caved in <br>
Between where we were standing <br>
And your voice was all I heard <br>
That I get what I deserve <br>
So give me reason <br>
To prove me wrong <br>
To wash this memory clean <br>
Let the floods cross <br>
The distance in your eyes <br>
Across this new divide <br>
In every loss, in every lie br
In every truth that you'd deny <br>
And each regret, and each goodbye <br>
Was a mistake too great to hide <br>
And your voice was all I heard <br>
That I get what I deserve <br>
So give me reason <br>
To prove me wrong <br>
To wash this memory clean <br>
Let the floods cross <br>
The distance in your eyes <br>
Give me reason <br>
To fill this hole <br>
Connect this space between <br>
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies <br>
Across this new divide <br>
Across this new divide <br>
Across this new divide <br>
