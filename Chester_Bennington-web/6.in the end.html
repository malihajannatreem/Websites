 It starts with one <br>
One thing I don't know why <br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <br>
To explain in due time <br>
All I know <br>
Time is a valuable thing <br>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
The clock ticks life away <br>
It's so unreal <br>
It's so unreal, didn't look out below <br>
Watch the time go right out the window <br>
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know <br>
I wasted it all just to watch you go <br>
Watch you go <br>
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard <br>
All I know <br>
It's so unreal <br>
Watch you go <br>
I tried so hard and got so far <br>
But in the end, it doesn't even matter <br>
I had to fall to lose it all <br>
But in the end, it doesn't even matter <br>
One thing, I don't know why <br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <br>
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard <br>
In spite of the way you were mockin' me <br>
Actin' like I was part of your property <br>
Remembering all the times you fought with me <br>
I'm surprised it got so far <br>
Things aren't the way they were before <br>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br>
Not that you knew me back then <br>
But it all comes back to me in the end <br>
You kept everything inside <br>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
What it meant to me will eventually <br>
Be a memory of a time when I <br>
I tried so hard and got so far <br>
But in the end, it doesn't even matter <br>
I had to fall to lose it all <br>
But in the end, it doesn't even matter <br>
One thing, I don't know why <br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
Keep that in mind <br>
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time <br>
All I know <br>
Time is a valuable thing <br>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
The clock ticks life away <br>
It's so unreal <br>
You didn't look out below <br>
Watch the time go right out the window <br>
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know <br>
I wasted it all just to watch you go <br>
I kept everything inside <br>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory <br>
Of a time when I tried so hard <br>
