 I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
Don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes <br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
I've become so numb <br>
I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired <br>
So much more aware <br>
I'm becoming this <br>
All I want to do <br>
Is be more like me <br>
And be less like you <br>
Can't you see that you're smothering me <br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control? <br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you <br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take <br>
I've become so numb <br>
I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired <br>
So much more aware <br>
I'm becoming this <br>
All I want to do <br>
Is be more like me <br>
And be less like you <br>
And I know <br>
I may end up failing too <br>
But I know <br>
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you <br>
I've become so numb <br>
I can't feel you there <br>
Become so tired <br>
So much more aware <br>
I'm becoming this <br>
All I want to do <br>
Is be more like me <br>
And be less like you <br>
I've become so numb <br>
I can't feel you there <br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be) <br>
I've become so numb <br>
I can't feel you there <br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
